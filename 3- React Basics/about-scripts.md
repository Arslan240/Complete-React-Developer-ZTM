# react-scripts
In Package.json file, we have react-scripts inside dependencies, then we have scripts: 

## react-scripts start
This will start with the localhost and present our react application.

## react-scripts build
We have two folders inside our root directory, public and src. We work in *src* foldler, where as when we run build command, the react code in src folder files is converted to older version of javscript (which a browser can understand)using webpack and babel. Those files are stored in the public folder.
